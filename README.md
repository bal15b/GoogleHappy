### PageRank
This function is the meat of the program and fulfills the PageRank requirement of the project by attempting to create our own version of Google's PageRank system that works for preferences. The majority of the work comes from an internal function inside of there called 'calc' that recieves how many nodes there are and then begins to count the links between the various nodes accepted. With the amount of links and the weight of the links, the PageRank for every single node is created.
### Perfs
The Perfs function scans in the files submitted by the user, filtering through them and accepting everyone's preferences in order. These are then sorted into arrays of descending preference, made fo reach individual person.
### PrimaryFunction
This function runs everything, it's the central hub through which all other functions are accessed. It also defines the map where the PageRank function will be run through.
